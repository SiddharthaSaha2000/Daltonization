## Autoencoder-Based Enhancement of Daltonized Images for Color Vision Deficiency (CVD): A Comparative Study with Glass-Based Correction

Color vision deficiency is the most common difficulty every human being faces. Currently, medical science lacks a longterm remedy. The subject of this research is to expose artificial intelligence methods as profound studies that aim at material, tangible visualization through images of color blindness in humanity, hence becoming a hope that technology will eventually fill the gap in color perception. 

The first model is Daltonization, which simulates the perception of color by different kinds of CVD and hence can create image transformations that specifically cater to oneâ€™s eye problems. Secondly, our proposed CNN-based
Autoencoder model, trains on various images taken under normal vision color conditions and daltonized color vision deficiency
(CVD) conditions. Therefore, the aim is to create an autoencoder that will convert any image into a better-colored one that is visible to individuals suffering from CVDs. The triumph of this
task is determined by how well it performs in terms of two criteria. 

Quantitative measurements allow for an analysis of the degree to which the latest picture reproduces original images through performance metric like SSIM (Structural Similarity
Index Measure), MS-SSIM (Multi Scale SSIM), PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity). 

We further validated our approach through comprehensive comparison with traditional glass-based correction methods, demonstrating significant improvements in color distinguishability (22.9% increase in distinct colors against vino)
and reduction in color confusion (29% improvement in CCI against enchroma-cx1) while maintaining real-time processing
capabilities. User testing and feedback obtained from people suffering from CVD constitute quality appraisals for verifying the acceptability of changes made to their visual perception
