# Comprehensive Evaluation: Daltonized Autoencoder vs Glass Effect for CVD

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates and compares the performance of a Daltonized Autoencoder approach against traditional Glass Effect methods in enhancing color distinguishability for individuals with Color Vision Deficiency (CVD). Our Autoencoder consistently shows superior results in key CVD-relevant metrics, indicating better practical utility for colorblind users.

## Key Metrics Interpretation for CVD

- **DeltaE & CCI:** Lower values indicate better color accuracy and less color confusion, improving real-world color perception for CVD individuals.
- **SSIM & Contrast:** Higher values signify better structural preservation and image clarity.
- **Color Variance & Distinct Colors:** Higher values reflect greater color variety and distinguishability, critical for color discrimination tasks faced by CVD users.
